# Nim-Game
Implementation of the Nim game in JavaScript canvas

What is Nim?

"Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object, or to take the last object."

In this implementation, there are 4 piles (rows in this case), containing 1, 3, 5, and 7 objects (in this case, cards) in each row, respectively. One player starts and removes at least one card per turn until all cards are gone, and the player that takes the last card loses.
